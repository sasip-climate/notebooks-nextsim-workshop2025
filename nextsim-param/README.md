In this part of the workshop, we'll examine how to write a new parameterisation for neXtSIM. In the example, we'll write a parameterisation of lateral ice formation and melt based on Mellor and Kantha (1989). We will try it out in the polynya setup from the nextsimdg session. We will focus on ice formation, as that setup does not cover ice melt. The work requires understanding the program structure and design presented earlier in the day.

The main steps to create a new parameterisation, which uses the existing module infrastructure, are:

 1. Identify the module to which the parameterisation belongs. In the demonstration case, this is the LateralSpreadModule in the [physics/src/modules/LateralIceSpreadModule](https://github.com/nextsimdg/nextsimdg/blob/1279acb6220bfbdd20ec847e5dfcbf992424a072/physics/src/modules/LateralIceSpreadModule]) directory.
 2. Implement the new functionality in a new source file (.cpp) and header file in the include directory. Make sure the new class inherits from the interface base class. In the demonstration case, this is [physics/src/modules/include/ILateralIceSpread.hpp](https://github.com/nextsimdg/nextsimdg/blob/b0ad5cf86e6082d2134c43a9b8ec2b286009cb63/physics/src/modules/include/ILateralIceSpread.hpp).
 3. Add the new module to the module.cfg file. In the demonstration case, this is [physics/src/modules/LateralIceSpreadModule/module.cfg](https://github.com/nextsimdg/nextsimdg/blob/60d09b143af90a1719dcdfb508173891d148bffc/physics/src/modules/LateralIceSpreadModule/module.cfg)
Rerun cmake to auto-generate the module.cpp file in the module directory.
